Contributing
============

Setting up the Project
----------------------

Fork the project with:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:frodsan/tynn.git
```

To install dependencies, use:

```
$ make install
```

To run the test suite, execute:

```
$ make test
```

You can install the gems globally, but we recommend [gs][gs] (or
[gst][gst] if you're using chruby) to keep things isolated. Also,
a `Gemfile` is included for Bundler users.

Reporting an Issue
------------------

If you've found a problem in Tynn, open a new issue on [GitHub][issues].

[issues]: https://github.com/frodsan/tynn/issues

Submitting Patches
------------------

Open a [pull request][pulls] explaining the proposed change. For new
features, it's important to explain the use case, we want to keep the
code base simple. In some cases, the result could be a creation of another
tool.
